# YoutubeVideoToAIPoweredShorts
This is a simple python script that takes a youtube link and converts it into shorts in chronological order. You need to upload it. This script also provides a prompt for ChatGPT so you can find out the best clip to use.





How to setup:

You need A folder on your computer that allows acess to python scripts. Name it what you like

Inside the Main folder create a folder name it what you like ex "ClipGenerator1"

inside the second folder create a second folder ex: "ClipGenerator2"

Inside the third folder create a third folder ex: "ClipGenerator3"


In a code editor open the script and copy the folder path name and replace them accordingly to the script. ![image](https://github.com/Fitsbit/YoutubeVideoToAIPoweredShorts/assets/107160828/bd3735f1-7815-4cde-9628-c1b50c3d0777)


once finished accordingly run the script and follow the instructions, you need a youtube URL from the actual adress bar not where you right click and copy a link. 

Eventually while running the script you will need to press "y" and enter. 


I may continue to work on this. 

The goal of this is to make a free altenrative to vidyo.ai and opus.pro

I did "AI" cause lamooooo

its not that good, but still I'm new
